Sub-\/\-Loop Inverse Kinematics Monte Carlo (S\-L\-I\-K\-M\-C) is a novel technique for sampling configurations of a kinematic chain according to a specified probability density while accounting for loop closure constraints. This method is an integration of two Markov chain Monte Carlo method, blocked Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-\/\-Hastings algorithm and it samples chain configurations in an unbiased manner. S\-L\-I\-K\-M\-C is applicable in sampling close-\/loop/free-\/end kinematic chains, protein loops in 3\-D space. The samples generated by S\-L\-I\-K\-M\-C are verified to have higher quality than ad-\/hoc fashion loop construction methods and sampling speed is proven to outrun methods based on discrete search.

S\-L\-I\-K\-M\-C is developed by Yajia Zhang and Kris Hauser at Intelligent Motion Lab in Indiana University Bloomington. S\-L\-I\-K\-M\-C is implemented using the software package Protein Loop Kinematic Toolkit (Loop\-T\-K, \href{https://simtk.org/home/looptk}{\tt https\-://simtk.\-org/home/looptk}) and released as an extension version of Loop\-T\-K.
